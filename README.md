csv-to-chart
============
Orginally I've done this for my thesis work. If you have lots of CSV data and you want to Make chart image to embed in other applications, this is ideal for you.

For example you first give paths in structure `"..\Data\Ackley\file name 1.csv" "..\Data\Ackley\file name 2.csv" "..\Data\Ackley\file name 3.csv"` like this. Image file will be generated in the same directory format except `Data` will be replace by `Charts`. So you will get generated image file in `"..\Charts\Ackley\file name 1.csv.png" "..\Charts\Ackley\file name 2.csv.png" "..\Charts\Ackley\file name 3.csv.png"`

For [this CSV file](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9592749/Permanent/All%20Data-Ackley-Best%20Fitness.csv), generated chart is like this.

I just needed line chart. Obviously you can easily modify this to generate other type of charts
